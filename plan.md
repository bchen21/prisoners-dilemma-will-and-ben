Our Plan:

1) Go with a "simple" Prisoner's Dilemma world
    a) Two creatures: Cooperator and Defector
    b) All creatures will use the same strategy (tit for tat, skeptical, spiteful, random, etc.)
    c) The entire world is filled with either a cooperator or a defector
    d) Each creature with interact with the four creatures in its four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west)
    e) Each interaction is ONE exchange between the creatures, meaning that 
    f) Creatures will take the best "state" (cooperate/defect) based on points into the next generation
    g) Repeat interactions for each generation
    h) Analyze results qualitatively (by looking at the grid and observing interesting patterns, such as Axelrod's snowflakes)
    
2) Generate questions based on results from the "simple" world

3) Extra: Create individual creatures that use different strategies (tit for tat, skeptical, spiteful, random, etc.)
    a) Watch how they interact
    b) Analyze results and observe how well each strategy fared in their interactions in the world
